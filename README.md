# JARVIS-Using-ML
I have created xolo an personal voice assistant app just like jarvis including machine learning so that it can answer user queries as well.

For runnning it you need to install a lot of libraries. I would suggest you go through the main file xolo.py and install all the libraries.

i would suggest you to use pycharm for running it and python version 3.7.11
